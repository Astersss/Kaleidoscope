For the kaleidoscope homework, I implement a kaleidoscope which has the following function:
User click Add and can add up to 20 different models. The shape can be oval, rectangle, triangle, square, pentagon.,etc
User can change the speed of the model. When I initially add the model, the speed of the model is actually set with a random value within the slow range.
User can change the move pattern of the kaleidoscope by clicking ChangeMove
User can delete or add a model or a reflection of a model.
User could set the size of the model
User could end the kaleidoscope show by clicking Clear(Default)
User could set the color of the model or set it to be random
